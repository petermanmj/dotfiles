# What is this?
These are shell configuration dotfiles forked from Matthew McCullough's work. The primary goal is increased CLI productivity on Mac OSX and Linux.

# Focus
The focus is on Zshell support, but there are plenty of cross-platform scripts in here. There are a few bash-specific ones.

# Acquiring This Repo
This project contains submodules. It is suggested that you clone this into your home directory.

    cd ~
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/matthewmccullough/dotfiles

# Setup
There is a set up script that establishes the symlinks in your home directory. Run this once.

* For ZShell
        `_setupdotfiles.zsh`
